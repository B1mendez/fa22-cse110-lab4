1. What will happen at line 12 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why. 
- The console log will return 3 because the for loop went through three iterations. The length of prices was three therefore the for loop went through 3 iterations. 

2. What will happen at line 13 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why. 
- The console log will return 150. The price will go through the list and at the end of the list (300), will discount 50 percent of 300 which will store 150 in discountedPrice. Therefore the console log will return discountedPrice.  

3. What will happen at line 14 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why. 
- The console log will return 150. The price will go through the list and at the end of the list (300), will discount 50 percent of 300 which will store 150 in finalPrice. Therefore the console log will return finalPrice.  

4. What will this function return? Give a brief explanation why. If the code causes an error, explain why.  
-The console log will return [50,100,150] because the for loop will split each value in the list. The discounted price is 50% and the loop will go through three iterations. 

5. What will happen at line 12 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why. (assume this function is being called like the others: discountPrices([100, 200, 300], 0.5)). 
- The terminal will return an error because the variable i is declared as a let variable which is a scope of the block statement. 

6. What will happen at line 13 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why. 
- The terminal will return an error because the variable discountedPrice is declared as a let variable which is a scope of the block statement. This variable is intialized in the for loop thus will not stay a variable outside of the for loop. 

7. What will happen at line 14 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why. 
- The console log will return 150 because the variable finalPrice is declared as a let variable which stays in the same scope. 

8. What will this function return? Give a brief explanation. If the code causes an error, explain why.
